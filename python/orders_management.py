ORDER AND CART MANAGEMENT

Orders are sets of items ordered by a customer
An ordered item has four components:
 - a name
 - a quantity (the number of such items bought)
 - a unit price (in pence)
 - a unit weight (in pounds)
Those are represented by a tuple.

NOTE: You can safely assume that all orders have all the required fields
(name, quantity, unit-price and unit-weight) so no validation needs to be made.

DO NOT MODIFY CONSTANTS

def add_item_to_order(name, quantity, order):
    """
    When a customer adds items to their basket, you need to update their order.

    The customer provides some of the details (the name of the item and
    the quantity they want). The rest (price and weight) needs to be looked up in
    the CATALOGUE provided above.

    NOTE: you must return a new order as a set and leave the argument unmodified.

    NOTE: if the order already contains some of the items, you must update the
    quantity field for that item; otherwise, you must add a new entry in the
    order

    NOTE: if the item cannot be found in the catalogue, the function should raise
    a KeyError.

    E.g., add_item_to_order("table", 1, {("table", 1, 9999, 20)}) is
        {("table", 2, 9999, 20)}
    E.g., add_item_to_order("chair", 1, {("table", 1, 9999, 20)}) is
